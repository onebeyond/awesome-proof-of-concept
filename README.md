## Best practices

Best practices are procedures and techniques that have been proved to be effective through repeated use, and often have come to be accepted as the standard way of doing things in a particular area of activity.

- [POC JSON Schemas and Semantic Versioning](https://github.com/UlisesGascon/POC-semver-and-json-schemas) — Discover the Power of JSON Schemas and Semantic Versioning: Unveiling the Potential of IoT and Event-Driven Architectures.
- [POC automation of releases](https://github.com/inigomarquinez/howto-release-please) — Use GitHub actions to automate the process of CHANGELOG generation, the creation of GitHub releases, and version bumps for your projects. Optionally publish them to the npm registry.


## DevOps

DevOps is the practice of creating a cross-functional team between developers and operations professionals to focus on efficiently delivering applications, services, and products to customers. DevOps teams strive to increase collaboration, communication, and coordination to produce results as quickly and efficiently as possible. This practice emphasizes the importance of working together to develop, deploy, and monitor applications quickly, reliably, and securely.

- [POC Secret Management with Blackbox](https://github.com/UlisesGascon/POC-secret-management-with-blackbox) —  Store secrets securely in Git using strong encryption without compromising the developer experience.
- [POC AWS Proton](https://github.com/guidesmiths/chapter-devops/tree/main/pocs/AwsProton) — Not only the conclusions after having tried this service, also a guide to configure a functional environment of it.
- [POC Node.js Machines Ping Dashboard](https://github.com/UlisesGascon/poc-nodejs-machines-ping-dashboard) - A simple way to visualize the Node.js Org Machines inventory and perform a cyclical ping to collect network metrics with a full dockerize environment and a fancy Grafana dashboard.


## Internet Of Things

Internet of things (IoT) is a concept where all physical devices are connected to the internet, gathering data and sharing it with each other to create a world of interconnected devices.

- [POC Azure IOT HUB - Device Communications](https://github.com/UlisesGascon/POC-azure-iot-hub-device-communications) — Azure IOT Hub - A Comprehensive Proof of Concept Walkthrough in Node.js!.
- [POC Azure IOT Digital Twins modeling](https://github.com/UlisesGascon/POC-azure-iot-digital-twins-modeling) — Unlock the Power of IoT with Azure Digital Twin Modeling
- [POC Azure IOT HUB - Ontology with Digital Twin Definition Language (DTDL)](https://github.com/UlisesGascon/POC-azure-IOT-DTDL-ontology) — The power of Ontology in the Digital Twins Definition Language universe to build powerful and sustainable devices.


## NodeJS

Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment, runs on the V8 JavaScript Engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

- [POC Streams processing large files](https://github.com/MatteoDiPaolo/googleTakeoutLocations-to-geoJson) — Node Streams based solution to translate Google Takeout Locations History large jsons to GeoJson.


## Frontend

The layer above the backend is the frontend and it includes all software or hardware that is part of a user interface. Human or digital users interact directly with various aspects of the frontend of a program, including user-entered data, buttons, programs, websites and other features.

- [POC Microfrontends](https://github.com/irenemherrero/microfrontends_poc) — Proposal on how to integrate microfrontends using Module Federation from Webpack 5.

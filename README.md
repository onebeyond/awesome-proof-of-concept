## Best practices

Best practices are procedures and techniques that have been proved to be effective through repeated use, and often have come to be accepted as the standard way of doing things in a particular area of activity.

- [POC JSON Schemas and Semantic Versioning](https://github.com/UlisesGascon/POC-semver-and-json-schemas) - Discover the Power of JSON Schemas and Semantic Versioning: Unveiling the Potential of IoT and Event-Driven Architectures.
- [POC automation of releases](https://github.com/inigomarquinez/howto-release-please) - Use GitHub actions to automate the process of CHANGELOG generation, the creation of GitHub releases, and version bumps for your projects. Optionally publish them to the npm registry.
- [POC securely share .env files](https://github.com/Bounteous17/POC-share-dot-env-securely) - Without the need for an external provider, share a `.env` file securely with your team using encryption.


## DevOps

DevOps is the practice of creating a cross-functional team between developers and operations professionals to focus on efficiently delivering applications, services, and products to customers. DevOps teams strive to increase collaboration, communication, and coordination to produce results as quickly and efficiently as possible. This practice emphasizes the importance of working together to develop, deploy, and monitor applications quickly, reliably, and securely.

- [POC Secret Management with Blackbox](https://github.com/UlisesGascon/POC-secret-management-with-blackbox) -  Store secrets securely in Git using strong encryption without compromising the developer experience.
- [POC AWS Proton](https://github.com/guidesmiths/chapter-devops/tree/main/pocs/AwsProton) - Not only the conclusions after having tried this service, also a guide to configure a functional environment of it.
- [POC Node.js Machines Ping Dashboard](https://github.com/UlisesGascon/poc-nodejs-machines-ping-dashboard) - A simple way to visualize the Node.js Org Machines inventory and perform a cyclical ping to collect network metrics with a full dockerize environment and a fancy Grafana dashboard.

- [PoC Packer with GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Paula-Encinar/Packer-PoC) - Guide on how to build a new Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with the Packer tool and then deploy an EC2 instance on AWS with that AMI using Terraform and GitHub Actions.

- [PoC Securing Databases on AWS](https://github.com/Paula-Encinar/DB-AWS-security-PoC) - Guide on the steps to take to keep a database secure on AWS and terraform template as an example to set up a secure database infrastructure.


## Internet Of Things

Internet of things (IoT) is a concept where all physical devices are connected to the internet, gathering data and sharing it with each other to create a world of interconnected devices.

- [POC Azure IOT HUB - Device Communications](https://github.com/UlisesGascon/POC-azure-iot-hub-device-communications) - Azure IOT Hub - A Comprehensive Proof of Concept Walkthrough in Node.js!.

- [POC Azure IOT Hub with Device Update installing custom package](https://github.com/UlisesGascon/poc-azure-iot-du-custom-package) - How to use Azure IOT Hub with Device Update installing .NET web application from a private debian package repository in a git repository.

## Node.js

Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment, runs on the V8 JavaScript Engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

- [POC Streams processing large files](https://github.com/MatteoDiPaolo/googleTakeoutLocations-to-geoJson) - Node Streams based solution to translate Google Takeout Locations History large jsons to GeoJson.


## Frontend

The layer above the backend is the frontend and it includes all software or hardware that is part of a user interface. Human or digital users interact directly with various aspects of the frontend of a program, including user-entered data, buttons, programs, websites and other features.

- [POC Microfrontends](https://github.com/irenemherrero/microfrontends_poc) - Proposal on how to integrate microfrontends using Module Federation from Webpack 5.
- [POC React app internationalization](https://github.com/inigomarquinez/howto-react-i18n) - Proposal on how to do the internationalization of a React application making use of some useful frameworks.

## .NET

.NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications. With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, games, and IoT.

- [POC Packaging a .NET Core Service for Ubuntu](https://github.com/UlisesGascon/poc-packaging-dot-net-core-service-for-ubuntu) - Package a .NET web server application as a Debian package.

## AI

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions) and self-correction.

- [POC Running local instance of stable-diffusion and Slack](https://github.com/onebeyond/poc-local-stable-diffusion) - Just showing how to use StableDiffusion via Slack.
